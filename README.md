# Arrowhead Conveyor belt

This repository contains an Arrowhead Adapter program that encapsulates the neccessary services to operate with a basic conveyor belt. The service implementations presented here are based on the ArrowheadESP library and the Arrowhead Adapter codebase. (These are Arduino programs that are written primarily for the ESP8266 microcontroller.)

## Requirements

In order to compile this program (e.g. in Arduino IDE), you will need the following libraries:

* [ESP8266 Arduino Core](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) or [ESP32 Arduino Core](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) if you are compiling to ESP microcontrollers
* [ArrowheadESP](https://github.com/arrowhead-f/ArrowheadESP)
* [Arrowhead Adapter](https://github.com/arrowhead-f/adapter-quick-demo-dev)

## Arrowhead configuration

In order to set up the Arrowhead adapter for your conveyor belt please refer to the documentation found in [this repository](https://github.com/bazileos/adapter-quick-demo-dev)
